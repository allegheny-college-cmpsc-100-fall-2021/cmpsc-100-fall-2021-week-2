# CMPSC 100: Week 2 reflection

* This week we exteded practice with `expressions`, `variables`, and `function`s
  * focusing specifically on `function`s to understand how they work and 
  * why we might write our own in addition to those which already exist for us to use
* We also discovered how to use new `function`s that we'd never seen before using minimum information and assumptions we can make about `function`s (e.g. `round()`) 
* In addition, we learned a bit about how to do an abstract version of problem solving called a "Fermi calculation" 

# What did you learn about problem solving strategies this week? How do you think you can put this into practice in the future?

`TODO`

# This lab required you to use `function`s. Highlight at least `2` reasons why you believe they were useful here and explain why.

`TODO`

# We also used `global`s and `local`s in this lab. What is an example of each and how did you use them? Can you speculate why something would be a `global`?

`TODO`

# Imagine you see a `function` called `calc_window_labor(hours, cost)`. What can you confidently say about it and its parameters (i.e. what can you assume)?

`TODO`

# Describe one success from the week and one challenge that you encountered. How did you arrive at each? How did you overcome your challenge?
